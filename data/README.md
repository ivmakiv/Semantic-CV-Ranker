# Data folder

This folder contains the CV files used to build and test the Talent Matching Assistant.

## What’s inside

* `data/CV/` — resumes (mostly PDFs, some image-based/scanned documents)

## Source

The CVs come from a public Kaggle dataset provided for this project:

* **Dataset name:** CV Database (Excel & PDF)
* **Author:** anissamylaamri
* **Platform:** Kaggle

## Notes

* The pipeline supports both text-based PDFs and scanned/image documents (OCR is applied when needed).
* If you prefer not to keep the dataset in the repository, you can download the same dataset from Kaggle and place the CV files under `data/CV/` with the same folder structure.
